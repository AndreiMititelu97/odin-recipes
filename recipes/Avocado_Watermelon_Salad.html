<h4>
    This is a very healthy, yet delightfully different salad.

    It has a very high water content and provides nutrients like lycopene, citrulline, and vitamins A and C. 
    Studies suggest that this sweet, red melon may even boost heart health, reduce muscle soreness, and decrease inflammation, though more research is needed.
